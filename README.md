# Watchers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/adavid9/watchers.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/adavid9/watchers)

### How to run?
> If you are using docker, you can just simply go to the root directory of the project
> and run the following command `docker-compose up` there is prepared a docker-compose file
> that puts the database together with the tables and run the application on port `8000`.
>
> If you are not using docker the you have to configure your own MySQL database with the 
> following credentials:
> `username: watchers_admin`
> `password: watchers_admin`
> `database: watchers`
> The database port should be `3306` and the port on which works the application is `8000`
> so before running it ensure that you have those ports free.
